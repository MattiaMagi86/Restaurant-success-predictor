## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Statistical Analysis**: Feature importance and correlation analysis

## 📊 Key Findings

### Success Factors (by importance):
1. **Customer Rating** (25.1% impact) - Most critical factor
2. **Rent per Seat** (10.9% impact) - Operational efficiency 
3. **Menu Pricing** (10.9% impact) - Strategic positioning

### Business Insights:
- Restaurants with 4.5+ ratings have **76.3% success rate** vs 24.3% for <3.5 ratings
- **Suburban locations** outperform downtown (58.1% vs 51.7% success rate)
- **Asian cuisine** shows highest success rate (59.4%)
- Optimal menu pricing: **$12-25 range** (58.9% success rate)
